# Secure Data Collection in UAV-Assisted IoT via Diffusion Model-Enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning

Abstract:
Leveraging the mobility and cost-effectiveness, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are frequently deployed in Internet of Things (IoT) systems to efficiently collect data from IoT devices (IoTDs). However, due to the broadcast nature of UAV wireless communication channels, they are highly susceptible to eavesdropping attacks, which can result in information leakage. In this paper, we investigate a dual UAV-assisted IoT data collection system under the threat of multiple eavesdroppers. Specifically, the primary UAV is responsible for collecting data from ground IoT devices, while the friendly jamming UAV generates jamming signals to interfere with eavesdroppers. We aim to minimize the age of information (AoI) of the IoTDs and the energy consumption of dual UAVs by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories and IoTD scheduling. Given the non-convex mixed-integer nature of the optimization problem, traditional optimization methods struggle to deal with the problem without precise prior knowledge. Therefore, we propose a denoising diffusion probabilistic model-based twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPM-TD3) algorithm. Specifically, we leverage the data modeling capability of the DDPM by integrating it with the actor network of TD3 to generate more rational actions. Simulation results indicate that DDPM-TD3 algorithm can effectively enhance the AoI performance and energy efficiency compared to several existing deep reinforcement learning benchmarks.
